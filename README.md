## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in the `data` directory. It includes a CSV file named `market_basket_data.csv`, which contains transaction data in the following format:

| Transaction ID | Products                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1              | Bread, Milk, Eggs         |
| 2              | Bread, Cheese, Yogurt     |
| 3              | Milk, Eggs, Juice         |
| ...            | ...                       |

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn (for data preprocessing)
- Apriori Algorithm (for association rule mining)

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/market-basket-insights.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd market-basket-insights
```

3. Run the analysis script:

```bash
python analyze_market_basket.py
```

4. The results will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Analysis

The main analysis script, `analyze_market_basket.py`, performs the following tasks:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Association rule mining using the Apriori algorithm
- Generating and saving association rules
- Visualization of association rules

## Results

The project generates association rules based on the provided dataset and stores them in the `output` directory. The results include rules with support, confidence, and lift measures, which can be used to make business decisions and optimize product placement and promotions.
